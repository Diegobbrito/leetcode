    /**
     * Explanation
     * <p>
     * Build Adjacency List:
     * First, create an adjacency list adj for each node, storing its neighbors. Initialize Leaves:
     * Find all nodes with only one connection (degree = 1), these are leaves. Trim Leaves:
     * Iteratively remove leaves and update their neighbors.
     * After removing a leaf, if a neighbor becomes a leaf, add it to the new set of leaves.
     * Continue trimming until only one or two nodes remain, which are the roots of the minimum height trees.
     * Return Result:
     * The remaining nodes in leaves are the roots of the Minimum Height Trees.
     * <p>
     * Complexity Analysis
     * Time Complexity:
     * O(n)
     * Building the adjacency list takes
     * O(n) time since there are nâˆ’1 edges.
     * Each node is processed once as a leaf, leading to a linear complexity.
     * Space Complexity: O(n)
     * The adjacency list uses O(n) space, and the list of leaves also takes O(n) in the worst case.
